6# Building AI Project

## Summary
This project describes an AI idea developed as part of the Building AI course. 
The goal of this idea is to create a simple and helpful AI system that can assist people in learning and solving daily problems by providing clear and understandable answers.

## Background
Many people struggle to access easy-to-understand learning support. 
This project aims to use artificial intelligence to act as a friendly assistant that helps users find information and learn new concepts.

## How is it used?
The AI system would be used by students and general users who need quick explanations or guidance.
Users interact with the system by asking questions, and the AI responds in simple language.

## Data sources and AI methods
The system would rely on text data and natural language processing techniques.
Machine learning models would be used to understand questions and generate appropriate answers.

## Challenges
The main challenges include ensuring accuracy of responses and keeping the information up to date.

## What next?
Future development could include adding support for more languages and improving response accuracy.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the Building AI course.
